- **Load and Display Images**: Select and display two images (Original and Morphed).
- **Edge Detection**: Computes edge detection using Canny edge detector for both images.
- **Difference Visualization**: Highlights the difference between the two images in **red**.
- **Forensics Analysis**: Computes and displays the count of edges detected in both images.
- **Graphical Representation**: Displays a bar graph comparing the edge counts of the original and morphed images.
